 * Description:
 *  This file serves as the entry point for the RTS Pathfinding Project.
 *  It currently displays a simple greeting message to confirm that the
 *  project is set up correctly. Subsequent stages will expand this file
 *  to load a map, perform pathfinding, and possibly output a new JSON
 *  with marked paths.
 *
 *  The project is designed to be modular, allowing for easy updates and
 *  changes in the future.
